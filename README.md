It’s Like IRC

===

This is a fork from Idel-IRC that’s being brought up to date and highly stylized to look more like slack since I want Slack at work but can’t have it.

TO DO LIST
—-

- Fix /me commands (just dying and not showing, did I break this?)
- Add + buttons that allow users to automatically issue commands like join a new server or join a new room
- Have rooms pop up in a modal window instead of flooding status
- Show user their username on the sidebar
- Add a slackbot instead of just ominous commands issued from nowhere
- A tally that shows how many messages since last checked
- ability to collapse users and not show them for a room

STRETCH GOALS
—-
- Emoji Support
- Giphy Support? (Important)


Usage
---

    /connect chat.freenode.net:6667 Freenode anonymous
    /join #IdelIRC
